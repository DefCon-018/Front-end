            HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, an organization formed by people working on the most popular web browser. This means it’s basically controlled by Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft
            In the past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organism in charge of creating the HTML standard.
            The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea.
            If you’ve never heard of XHTML, here’s a short story. In the early 2000, we all believed the future of the Web was XML (seriously). So HTML moved from being a SGML-based authoring language to a XML markup language.
            It was a big change. We had to know, and respect, more rules. Stricter rules.

                    I mentioned tags and elements. What’s the difference?Elements have a starting tag, and closing tag.In this case, we use the p starting and closing tags to create a p element.
